        h2 App Description
        h3 Context:
        p A friend of mine is a keen artist. He recently received his first commissioned work, and was interesting in selling original artworks he had painted to the public. 
        p I saw this as a great opportunity to take on my first solo web project. 
        p I also really wanted to take this chance to learn more about designing responsive websites on my own (see the Mobile demo where the viewport is narrow).
        h3 Process and Learning Outcomes:
        p I managed to develop the website in about a week using Express.js and Git, hosted on Heroku. 
        p I learned a lot about CSS and front-end development as the majority of my background knowledge was in back-end programming.
        h3 Outcomes:
        p Zach is now able to generate income from his passion by selling his work online, and promote it with a professional website.
        h2 Stack
        p Front End: Pug (HTML), CSS
        p Back End: Express.js
